#cs33211
Hello, my name is Ean Dodge. This is a program that has an algorithm for the bankers problem. It will solve the given problem in the prompt, and will say the safe sequence at the end.

**What does the code contain?**
The project has two files.
It has banker.cpp and it has bank.txt. Banker.cpp has the algorithm in it. This include input code to input from bank.txt, which includes data needed from table. It is in the form of 
-Allocation
-Max
-Available
(See bank.txt for example)

**how to run the program**
you will need both banker.cpp and bank.txt included in the folder/directory.
you can then just simply do
- g++ banker.cpp -o bank.o
- ./bank.o

**problems faced**
I faced problems with the input file funtions. I was not too sure how to do it, but i looked back to my CS2 
notes and that helped me do what i needed to do. The algorithm was based off of a tutorial from geeks for geeks. This is a website that has problems like these to help understand how they can be implemented.
